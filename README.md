# Scripts for Airtable Script Block
A collection of scripts for Airtable Script Block by the team at Deytah.

- [Attachment Automator](https://github.com/deytah/airtable-scripts/blob/master/upload-attachments-from-urls.js) helps upload images from URLs as Attachments in bulk.
- [Find Match and Link](https://github.com/deytah/airtable-scripts/blob/master/find-match-and-link.js) finds a record based on the string on a field and creates a link for you. This enables you to modify the string before lookup and run the search multiple ways. We built this script to create linked records based off a multi-select field. It made the process of converting and connecting ~1000 records super fast.
